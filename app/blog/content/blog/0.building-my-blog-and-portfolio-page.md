# Introduction to the Series: Building My Blog and Portfolio Page

My goal with this series is to share my experiences with you. I'll begin by creating a blog website and providing step-by-step guidance on how to get started. As we progress, I'll also explore the creation of custom analytical tools to demonstrate my expertise in software design and software architecture.

What's great is that starting this journey is easy; you don't need extensive prior knowledge. You can begin with just a little understanding, and we'll build up your skills together. I'll try to include as many resources as possible to dive deeper into each topic.

Let's keep it simple and accessible.

**Here Are All the Articles in the Series:**

- [**Part 1: Creating a Blog Page Using Nuxt.js**](/blog/creating-a-blog-page-using-nuxt)
- ...

You can access the project code on [GitHub](https://github.com/marosmola/blog), and each article will have its separate branch for easy code reference.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey!
