        I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote my
        first program when I was 6 years old, just two weeks after my mom
        brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to type
        on.

        The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space. When I
        was 8, I climbed the 40-foot oak tree at the back of our yard while
        wearing my older sister’s motorcycle helmet, counted down from three,
        and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough that with just a bit of
        momentum I’d be able to get to orbit.
